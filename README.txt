    This website is designed to allow users to signup and register within our database. 
    Users must complete all the registration requirements in order to successfully sign up. 
    Once registered, users will be able to see their information which they previously entered. 
    Users are now able to post products with a title, description, categories, and price. 
    Users may also review other people's products in the 'reviews' page. 
    Users are limited to 3 posts and 3 reviews a day. 
    Lastly, users may use the 'initialize database' to create/recreate the tables and popualte them with randomly-generated data.
