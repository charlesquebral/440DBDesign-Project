    This website is designed to allow users to signup and register within our database. Users must complete all the registration requirements in order to successfully sign up. Once registered, users will be able to see their information which they previously entered. Each requirement for Phase 1 was thoroughly tested to assure full functionality. The project was implemented through Python, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.
